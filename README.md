# Robotics
Some programs I've worked on with the Robotics Club. Credit to Jonathan, TG, Josh, Jesse and Akeer for all contributing to these projects.

In this repository are some of the best projects from the robotics club this year. The FollowTheLine.py and SelfDrivingCar.py programs are both for a self driving car that the team built and programmed 
for an exhibition earlier this year. As the name suggests the car can drive without being controlled through the use of sensors, and has the ability to follow a set path/ line precisely without remote
input.
